# DOCUMENT

THIS IS NOT A CODE REPOSITORY!

This project is a repository where I keep document which can be useful in a professional environment. Sometime, I need to do some technical interview or skills review of my team. Since the format is quite the same for every company, I save them in a place and will use them again. I might twist them a little but the main structure or content of the document is already good for me.

Feel free to look at it and give me a feedback for improving my skills for managing team ;)
